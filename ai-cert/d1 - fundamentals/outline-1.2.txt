Task Statement 1.2: Identify practical use cases for AI
1. Recognize applications where AI/ML can provide value
Assist Human Decision Making
Key Value Areas:

Enhanced Pattern Recognition: AI can identify patterns humans might miss
Data Processing at Scale: Process vast amounts of information quickly
Consistent Analysis: Reduce variability in decision-making
Risk Assessment: Evaluate multiple factors simultaneously

Examples:

Strategic business planning with market analysis

Solution Scalability
Key Benefits:

Automation of Repetitive Tasks: Handle increasing workloads without linear cost increases
24/7 Availability: Provide services continuously
Personalization at Scale: Customize experiences for millions of users

Examples:

Automation Opportunities
Areas Where AI Excels:

Process Automation: Streamline workflows and reduce manual intervention
Quality Control: Detect defects and anomalies automatically
Resource Optimization: Improve efficiency in operations

Examples:

Automated invoice processing and accounts payable
Supply chain optimization and inventory management
Predictive maintenance for industrial equipment
Automated content generation and curation

2. Determine when AI/ML solutions are not appropriate
Cost-Benefit Analysis Considerations
When Traditional Solutions Are Better:

Simple Rule-Based Problems: If logic can be explicitly programmed
Small-Scale Applications: Where manual processes are more cost-effective
One-Time Tasks: Where development costs exceed benefits
Limited Data Scenarios: Insufficient data for training

Red Flags for AI Implementation:

Development costs exceed ROI within reasonable timeframe
Maintenance and retraining costs are prohibitive
Existing solutions already meet requirements effectively
Regulatory constraints make AI deployment infeasible

Situations Requiring Specific Outcomes
When Predictions Are Insufficient:

Life-Critical Decisions: Medical procedures requiring 100% accuracy
Legal Compliance: Where specific regulatory outcomes are mandated
Safety-Critical Systems: Nuclear plant operations, aviation controls
Financial Transactions: Where approximate values are unacceptable

Deterministic Requirements:

Systems requiring guaranteed outcomes
Applications needing audit trails with full explainability
Processes where human oversight cannot be removed
Situations requiring immediate human intervention
