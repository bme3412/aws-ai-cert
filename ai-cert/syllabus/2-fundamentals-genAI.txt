Task Statement 2.1: Explain the basic concepts of generative AI.
Objectives:
• Understand foundational generative AI concepts (for example, tokens,
chunking, embeddings, vectors, prompt engineering, transformer-based
LLMs, foundation models, multi-modal models, diffusion models).
• Identify potential use cases for generative AI models (for example, image,
video, and audio generation; summarization; chatbots; translation; code
generation; customer service agents; search; recommendation engines).
• Describe the foundation model lifecycle (for example, data selection, model
selection, pre-training, fine-tuning, evaluation, deployment, feedback). 

Task Statement 2.2: Understand the capabilities and limitations of generative AI for
solving business problems.
Objectives:
• Describe the advantages of generative AI (for example, adaptability,
responsiveness, simplicity).
• Identify disadvantages of generative AI solutions (for example,
hallucinations, interpretability, inaccuracy, nondeterminism).
• Understand various factors to select appropriate generative AI models (for
example, model types, performance requirements, capabilities, constraints,
compliance).
• Determine business value and metrics for generative AI applications (for
example, cross-domain performance, efficiency, conversion rate, average
revenue per user, accuracy, customer lifetime value). 

Task Statement 2.3: Describe AWS infrastructure and technologies for building
generative AI applications.
Objectives:
• Identify AWS services and features to develop generative AI applications
(for example, Amazon SageMaker JumpStart; Amazon Bedrock; PartyRock,
an Amazon Bedrock Playground; Amazon Q).
• Describe the advantages of using AWS generative AI services to build
applications (for example, accessibility, lower barrier to entry, efficiency,
cost-effectiveness, speed to market, ability to meet business objectives).
• Understand the benefits of AWS infrastructure for generative AI
applications (for example, security, compliance, responsibility, safety).
• Understand cost tradeoffs of AWS generative AI services (for example,
responsiveness, availability, redundancy, performance, regional coverage,
token-based pricing, provision throughput, custom models).
