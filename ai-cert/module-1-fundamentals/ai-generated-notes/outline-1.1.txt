# Domain 1: Fundamentals of AI and ML

## Task Statement 1.1: Explain basic AI concepts and terminologies

### 1. Define basic AI terms

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
- The simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems
- Encompasses the ability to learn, reason, perceive, and understand
- Often categorized into narrow AI (specialized) and general AI (human-level across all domains)

**Machine Learning (ML)**
- A subset of AI that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed
- Uses statistical techniques to give computer systems the ability to improve automatically through experience
- Forms the foundation for most modern AI applications

**Deep Learning**
- A subset of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep architectures)
- Particularly effective for processing complex data like images, speech, and text
- Inspired by the human brain's neural structure

**Neural Networks**
- Computing systems inspired by biological neural networks
- Composed of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through weighted connections
- Activation functions determine the output of each node

**Computer Vision**
- Field of AI that trains computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world
- Applications include image classification, object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous vehicles
- Often leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- Branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and manipulate human language
- Includes tasks like translation, sentiment analysis, text generation, and language understanding
- Powers applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, and language translation services

**Model**
- A representation of real-world processes or systems learned from data
- In ML context, it's the output of a training process that can make predictions on new data
- Defined by parameters learned during training

**Algorithm**
- A set of rules or instructions for solving a problem or completing a task
- In ML, algorithms determine how a model learns from data
- Examples include linear regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting

**Training**
- The process of teaching an ML model to make accurate predictions
- Involves feeding data to the algorithm, which adjusts parameters to minimize errors
- Results in a model that can generalize to new, unseen data

**Inferencing**
- The process of using a trained model to make predictions on new data
- Also called inference or prediction
- Can be performed in real-time or batch processing

**Bias**
- Statistical bias: error from overly simplistic assumptions in the learning algorithm
- Societal bias: unfair discrimination against certain groups in ML predictions
- Can lead to systematic errors or prejudicial outcomes

**Fairness**
- Ensuring that ML models do not produce discriminatory outcomes
- Involves preventing bias against protected groups
- Critical consideration in AI ethics and responsible AI development

**Fit**
- Refers to how well a model captures the underlying pattern in training data
- Overfitting: model memorizes training data but performs poorly on new data
- Underfitting: model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns

**Large Language Model (LLM)**
- Neural network models with billions or trillions of parameters
- Trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language
- Examples include GPT-4, BERT, and Claude

### 2. Similarities and Differences between AI, ML, and Deep Learning

**Hierarchy and Relationships:**
- AI (Artificial Intelligence) is the broadest concept
- ML (Machine Learning) is a subset of AI
- Deep Learning is a subset of ML

**AI**
- Encompasses all computer systems that exhibit intelligent behavior
- Can include rule-based systems, expert systems, and symbolic reasoning
- Not all AI requires learning from data

**Machine Learning**
- Specifically focuses on systems that learn from data
- Requires statistical methods and algorithms
- Always involves data and pattern recognition

**Deep Learning**
- Uses neural networks with multiple hidden layers
- Requires large amounts of data and computational power
- Particularly effective for unstructured data like images and text

### 3. Types of Inferencing

**Real-time Inferencing**
- Processes data immediately as it arrives
- Low-latency responses (milliseconds to seconds)
- Examples: fraud detection, recommendation systems, autonomous vehicles
- Requires optimized models and infrastructure

**Batch Inferencing**
- Processes large volumes of data periodically
- Higher latency acceptable (minutes to hours)
- Examples: monthly sales forecasts, quarterly risk assessments
- More cost-effective for large volumes

**Other Inferencing Types:**
- Streaming inference: continuous processing of data streams
- Edge inference: processing at the data source (IoT devices)
- Distributed inference: processing across multiple machines

### 4. Types of Data in AI Models

**Labeled Data**
- Data with known outcomes or targets
- Essential for supervised learning
- Examples: images with tags, emails marked as spam/not spam

**Unlabeled Data**
- Data without predefined outcomes
- Used in unsupervised learning
- Often more abundant but less immediately useful

**Tabular Data**
- Structured data organized in rows and columns
- Common in traditional ML applications
- Examples: spreadsheets, databases, CSV files

**Time-series Data**
- Data points collected over time intervals
- Order matters; temporal patterns are important
- Examples: stock prices, sensor readings, web traffic

**Image Data**
- Visual information in pixel format
- Requires specialized preprocessing and models (CNNs)
- Examples: photographs, medical scans, satellite imagery

**Text Data**
- Unstructured linguistic information
- Requires tokenization and encoding
- Examples: documents, social media posts, customer reviews

**Structured Data**
- Highly organized, easily searchable information
- Fits into predefined schemas
- Examples: relational databases, XML files

**Unstructured Data**
- Information without predefined organization
- Often contains valuable insights but harder to process
- Examples: images, videos, natural language text

### 5. Learning Paradigms

**Supervised Learning**
- Uses labeled data to learn input-output mappings
- Goal: predict outcomes for new, unseen data
- Types:
  - Classification: predicting categories (spam detection, image recognition)
  - Regression: predicting continuous values (price prediction, demand forecasting)
- Examples of algorithms: linear regression, decision trees, random forests, SVMs

**Unsupervised Learning**
- Discovers patterns in data without labeled outcomes
- Goal: understand data structure and relationships
- Types:
  - Clustering: grouping similar data points (customer segmentation)
  - Dimensionality reduction: simplifying data while preserving information
  - Association rule learning: finding correlations between variables
- Examples of algorithms: k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, PCA

**Reinforcement Learning**
- Learns optimal behavior through interaction with an environment
- Receives rewards or penalties for actions
- Goal: maximize cumulative reward over time
- Key concepts:
  - Agent: the learner/decision maker
  - Environment: what the agent interacts with
  - State: current situation
  - Action: choices available to the agent
  - Reward: feedback from environment
- Examples: game playing (AlphaGo), robotics, autonomous systems
