            <h2>3. Machine Learning Fundamentals</h2>
            
            <p>Machine learning is the science of developing algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform complex tasks without explicit instructions. Computer systems use ML algorithms to process large quantities of historical data and identify data patterns.</p>
            
            <h3>How Machine Learning Works</h3>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Algorithm Foundation:</strong> Start with a mathematical algorithm that takes data as inputs and generates an output</li>
                <li><strong>Training Process:</strong> Give the algorithm known data consisting of features (columns in a table or pixels in an image)</li>
                <li><strong>Pattern Recognition:</strong> The algorithm finds correlations between input data features and expected output</li>
                <li><strong>Parameter Adjustment:</strong> Internal parameter values are adjusted until the model reliably produces expected output</li>
                <li><strong>Inference:</strong> The trained model makes accurate predictions on new, unseen data</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="data-types">
            <h2>4. Types of Data for Machine Learning</h2>
            
            <h3>Structured Data</h3>
            <p>The easiest to understand and process. Stored as rows in tables with columns serving as features.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Text files like CSV</li>
                <li>Relational databases (Amazon RDS, Amazon Redshift)</li>
                <li>Queryable using SQL</li>
                <li>Exported to Amazon S3 for model training</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Semi-Structured Data</h3>
            <p>Doesn't completely follow structured tabular data rules. Elements can have different or missing attributes.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files</li>
                <li>Features represented as key-value pairs</li>
                <li>Stored in Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon DocumentDB</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Unstructured Data</h3>
            <p>Doesn't conform to any specific data model and can't be stored in table format.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Images, videos, text files</li>
                <li>Social media posts</li>
                <li>Stored as objects in Amazon S3</li>
                <li>Features derived through processing techniques like tokenization</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Time Series Data</h3>
            <p>Important for training models that predict future trends. Each record is labeled with a timestamp and stored sequentially.</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Microservice performance metrics (memory usage, CPU percentage, transactions per second) used to predict when infrastructure scaling is needed.

            <h2>5. ML Algorithms and Training</h2>
            
            <p>To create a machine learning model, we start with an algorithm that defines the mathematical relationship between outputs and inputs.</p>
            
            <h3>Linear Regression Example</h3>
            <p>Finding the best fit line to match input data using the equation: <strong>y = mx + b</strong></p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Using height and weight data where h = mw + b, with slope (m) and intercept (b) as model parameters adjusted during training to minimize errors.
            </div>
            
            <h3>Model Artifacts</h3>
            <p>The training process produces model artifacts consisting of:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Trained parameters</li>
                <li>Model definition describing how to compute inferences</li>
                <li>Other metadata</li>
                <li>Inference code (software that implements the model)</li>

                <li>Suitable for offline processing with large amounts of upfront data</li>
                <li>No need for persistent endpoint</li>
                <li>More cost-effective for large numbers of inferences</li>
                <li>Computing resources only run when processing, then shut down</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Monthly inventory forecasting using historical sales data - process all data at once on a schedule to generate reports.

            <h2>7. Machine Learning Styles</h2>
            
            <h3>Supervised Learning</h3>
            <p>Train models with pre-labeled data specifying both input and desired output.</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> Training an image classifier with pictures labeled as "fish" or "not fish." The model learns to recognize patterns in pixels and generates probability scores.

            <div class="highlight">
                <p><strong>Challenge:</strong> Requires extensive data labeling. Models might need thousands of labeled examples. Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth and Amazon Mechanical Turk can help with crowdsourced labeling.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Unsupervised Learning</h3>
            <p>Trains on data with features but no labels. Can spot patterns, group data into clusters, and split data into categories.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Use Cases:</strong></p>
            <ul>

            <h2>9. Generative AI</h2>
            
            <p>Generative AI represents the next step in artificial intelligence, capable of having seemingly intelligent conversations and generating original content like stories, images, videos, and music.</p>
            
            <h3>How Generative AI Works</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Uses deep learning models pre-trained on extremely large datasets</li>
                <li>Processes sequences of text or other data</li>
                <li>Uses <strong>transformer neural networks</strong> that convert input sequences (prompts) into output sequences (responses)</li>
                <li>Processes sequences in parallel (faster than sequential processing)</li>
                <li>Enables use of much bigger datasets</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Large Language Models (LLMs)</h3>
            <p>Contain billions of features capturing wide range of human knowledge, making them very flexible in task performance.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Capabilities:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding and summarizing long articles</li>
                <li>Generating human-like text</li>
                <li>Language translation</li>
                <li>Writing original stories, letters, articles, and poetry</li>
                <li>Programming in computer languages</li>
                <li>Writing code for software developers</li>
            </ul>
            
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example Prompt:</strong> "Generate a song from these lyrics: In order to pass the exam, you'll need to know AI."
                <br><br>
                <strong>Result:</strong> Complete song lyrics with verses, chorus, bridge, and outro that mostly rhyme.

            <h2>10. Model Challenges and Quality</h2>
            
            <h3>Overfitting</h3>
            <p>When a model performs better on training data than on new data. The model fits the training data too well and doesn't generalize.</p>
            
            <div class="example">
                <strong>Example:</strong> A fish recognition model trained only on images of fish swimming in water might not recognize fish out of water.
            </div>
            
            <p><strong>Solutions:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Train with more diverse data</li>
                <li>Avoid training for too long (prevents overemphasis on noise)</li>
                <li>Find the sweet spot for training time</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Underfitting</h3>
            <p>When a model cannot determine meaningful relationships between input and output data, giving inaccurate results for both training and new data.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Causes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Insufficient training time</li>
                <li>Dataset too small</li>
                <li>Model too simple for the complexity of the data</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Bias</h3>
            <p>Disparities in model performance across different groups, with results skewed in favor of or against particular outcomes.</p>
            
            <div class="warning">
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> A loan approval model trained without enough applications from diverse populations might learn biased patterns. If there are no approved applications from 25-year-old women in Wisconsin in the training data, the model might incorrectly learn to reject such applications regardless of income and job history.</p>
            </div>
            
            <h3>Ensuring Model Quality and Fairness</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Data Quality:</strong> Model quality depends on underlying data quality and quantity</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Weight Adjustment:</strong> Data scientists can adjust weights of features introducing noise</li>
                <li><strong>Feature Removal:</strong> Remove problematic features (e.g., gender) from consideration</li>
                <li><strong>Fairness Constraints:</strong> Identify constraints like age and sex discrimination before model creation</li>
                <li><strong>Data Inspection:</strong> Training data should be evaluated for potential bias</li>
                <li><strong>Continuous Evaluation:</strong> Models need ongoing fairness assessment</li>
            </ul>
