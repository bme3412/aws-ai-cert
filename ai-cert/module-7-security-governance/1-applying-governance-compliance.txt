Security: Ensure that confidentiality, integrity, and availability are maintained for organizational data and information assets and infrastructure. This function is often called information security or cybersecurity in an organization.
Governance: Ensure that an organization can add value and manage risk in the operation of business.
Compliance: Ensure normative adherence to requirements across the functions of an organization.

Defense in depth for AI on AWS
A defense in depth security strategy uses multiple redundant defenses to protect your AWS accounts, workloads, data, and assets. It helps make sure that if any one security control is compromised or fails, additional layers exist to help isolate threats and prevent, detect, respond, and recover from security events.

The importance of governance and compliance for AI systems
- Managing, optimizing, and scaling the organizational AI initiative is at the core of the governance perspective. Incorporating AI governance into an organizationâ€™s AI strategy is instrumental in building trust. Governance also helps in enabling the deployment of AI technologies at scale, and overcoming challenges to drive business transformation and growth
- Governance and compliance are important for AI systems used in business to ensure responsible and trustworthy AI practices. As AI systems become more prevalent in decision-making processes, it is essential to have robust governance frameworks and compliance measures in place to mitigate risks. These risks include bias, privacy violations, and unintended consequences.
- Governance helps organizations establish clear policies, guidelines, and oversight mechanisms to ensure AI systems align with legal and regulatory requirements, in addition to ethical principles and societal values. Therefore, governance protects the organization from potential legal and reputational risks. It also fosters public trust and confidence in the responsible deployment of AI technologies within the business context.

AWS compliance
AWS compliance empowers customers to understand the robust controls in place at AWS to maintain security and data protection in the AWS Cloud. AWS supports 143 security standards and compliance certifications.

AI standards compliance influences how organizations follow established guidelines, rules, and legal requirements that govern the development, deployment, and use of AI technologies.
- Complexity and opacity: AI systems, especially large language models (LLMs) and generative AI, can be highly complex with opaque decision-making processes. This makes it challenging to audit and understand how they arrive at outputs, which is crucial for compliance.
- Dynamism and adaptablity: AI systems are often dynamic and can adapt and change over time, even after deployment. This makes it difficult to apply static standards, frameworks, and mandates.
- Emergent capabilities: Emergent capabilities in AI systems refer to unexpected or unintended capabilities that arise as a result of complex interactions within the AI system. In contrast to capabilities that are explicitly programmed or designed.
- Unique risks: AI poses novel risks, such as algorithmic bias, privacy violations, misinformation, and AI-powered automation displacing human workers. Traditional requirements might not adequately address these.
- Algorithm accountability: Algorithm accountability refers to the idea that algorithms, especially those used in AI systems, should be transparent, explainable, and subject to oversight and accountability measures. These safeguards are important because algorithms can have significant impacts on individuals and society. They can potentially perpetuate biases or make decisions that violate human rights or the principles of responsible AI.

Regulated workloads
- Regulated is a common term used to indicate that a workload might need special consideration, because of some form of compliance that must be achieved.
- This term often refers to customers who work in industries with high degrees of regulatory compliance requirements or high industrial demands. 

AWS Governance and Compliance
- AWS takes a proactive and collaborative approach to governance and compliance when it comes to AI and generative AI workflows. AWS works closely with regulators, customers, and other stakeholders to ensure these technologies are used responsibly and in alignment with relevant laws and regulations.
- 1. AWS Config provides a detailed view of the configuration of AWS resources in your AWS account. This includes how the resources are related to one another and how they were configured in the past so that you can see how the configurations and relationships change over time.
    - When you run your applications on AWS, you usually use AWS resources, which you must create and manage collectively. As the demand for your application keeps growing, so does your need to keep track of your AWS resources.
- 2. Amazon Inspector is a vulnerability management service that continuously scans your AWS workloads for software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure.  
    - Amazon Inspector automatically discovers and scans running AWS resources for known software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. Some of these resources include Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, container images, and Lambda functions. Amazon Inspector creates a finding when it discovers a software vulnerability or network configuration issue. 
- 3. AWS Audit Manager: AWS Audit Manager helps you continually audit your AWS usage to streamline how you manage risk and compliance with regulations and industry standards. 
    - Audit Manager automates evidence collection so you can conveniently assess whether your policies, procedures, and activities (also known as controls) are operating effectively. When it's time for an audit, Audit Manager helps you manage stakeholder reviews of your controls.
- 4. AWS Artifact: AWS Artifact provides on-demand downloads of AWS security and compliance documents, such as AWS ISO certifications, PCI reports, and SOC Reports. 
    - You can submit the security and compliance documents to your auditors or regulators to demonstrate the security and compliance of your AWS infrastructure.
- 5. AWS CloudTrail: AWS CloudTrail helps you perform operational and risk auditing, governance, and compliance of your AWS account. Actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service are recorded as events in CloudTrail. Events include actions taken in the AWS Management Console, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS SDKs and APIs.
- 6. AWS Trusted Adivsor: AWS Trusted Advisor helps you optimize costs, increase performance, improve security and resilience, and operate at scale in the cloud. 

Data governance strategies
- Data governance strategies for AI and generative AI workloads involve an approach to managing the data lifecycle, from data collection and storage, to data usage and security. The following are some key data governance strategies that organizations can consider.

Approaches for Implementing Governance Strategies
When working with generative AI solutions, it's important to establish and follow governance strategies to ensure responsible development and deployment. 
- Policies: Develop clear and comprehensive policies that outline the organization's approach to generative AI, including principles, guidelines, and responsible AI considerations.
- Review Cadence: Implement a regular review process to assess the performance, safety, and responsible AI implications of the generative AI solutions.
- Review Strategies: Develop comprehensive review strategies that cover both technical and non-technical aspects of the generative AI solutions.

Monitoring an AI system
- Monitoring an AI system is necessary to ensure its performance, reliability, and compliance with the intended use case. Effective monitoring can help identify issues, optimize system performance, and maintain overall system health.
