1. AI is a broad field that encompasses the development of intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as perception, reasoning, learning, problem-solving, and decision-making. AI serves as an umbrella term for various techniques and approaches, including machine learning, deep learning, and generative AI. 
2. ML is subset of AI for understanding and building methods that make it possible for machines to learn. These methods use data to improve computer performance on a set of tasks.
3. Deep learning uses the concept of neurons and synapses similar to how our brain is wired.
4. Generative AI is a subset of deep learning because it can adapt models built using deep learning, but without retraining or fine tuning. 
    Generative AI is capable of generating new data based on the patterns and structures learned from training data.
    It can create new content, including conversations, stories, images, videos, music, and code.

Examples of real-world use cases:
AI contributes to media and entertainment in the following ways:
    Content generation: AI can create scripts, dialogues, or even complete stories for films, TV shows, and games.
    Virtual reality: AI can create immersive and interactive virtual environments for games or simulations.
    New generation: AI can generate articles or summaries based on raw data or events.

AI contributes to retail in the following ways:
    Product review summaries: AI can generate review summaries for products so consumers can quickly find pertinent information.
    Pricing optimization: AI can model different pricing scenarios to determine optimal pricing strategies that maximize profits.
    Virtual try-ons: AI can generate virtual models of customers for virtual try-ons, which can improve the online shopping experience.
    Store layout optimization: AI can generate the most efficient store layouts to improve the customer shopping experience and boost sales.

AI contributes to healthcare in the following ways:
    AWS HealthScribe: This AWS service empowers healthcare software vendors to build clinical applications that automatically generate clinical notes by analyzing patient-clinician conversations.
    Personalize medicine: By generating treatment plans based on a patient's specific genetic makeup, lifestyle, and disease progression, AI can contribute to more effective, personalized care.
    Improve medical imaging: AI can enhance, reconstruct, or even generate medical images, like X-rays, MRIs, or CT scans, which can aid in better diagnosis.

AI contributes to life sciences in the following ways:
    Drug discovery: AI can generate new potential molecular structures for drugs and accelerate the process of drug discovery and reducing costs.
    Protein folding prediction: AI can predict the 3D structures of proteins based on their amino acid sequence, which is crucial for understanding diseases and developing new therapies.
    Synthetic biology: AI can generate designs for synthetic biological systems, such as engineered organisms or biological circuits

AI contributes to financial services in the following ways:
    Fraud detection mechanisms: AI can help create synthetic datasets to improve AI and ML systems by simulating various money-laundering patterns.
    Portfolio management: AI can simulate various market scenarios and help in the creation and management of robust investment portfolios.
    Debt collection: AI can generate the most effective communication and negotiation strategies for debt collection to increase the rate of successful collections

AI contributes to manufacturing in the following ways:
    Predictive maintenance: By analyzing historical production data, AI can predict maintenance schedules that will provide the most efficient machine outputs and reduce downtimes.
    Process optimization: AI can generate the most efficient production processes by modeling different scenarios and optimizing for variables such as cost, time, resource usage, and so forth.
    Product design: AI can be used to create new product designs based on set parameters and constraints. It can generate multiple design options and optimize for factors like cost, materials, performance, and so forth.
    Material science: AI can help generate new material compositions with desired properties.

AI applications:
1. Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence that allows computers to interpret and understand digital images and videos. Deep learning has revolutionized computer vision by providing powerful techniques for tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.
2. NLP is a branch of artificial intelligence that deals with the interaction between computers and human languages. Deep learning has made significant strides in NLP. It can perform tasks such as text classification, sentiment analysis, machine translation, and language generation.
3. Intelligent Document Parsing - IDP is an application that extracts and classifies information from unstructured data, generates summaries, and provides actionable insights.
4. Fraud detection refers to the process of identifying and preventing fraudulent activities or unauthorized behavior with a system, process, or transaction.
