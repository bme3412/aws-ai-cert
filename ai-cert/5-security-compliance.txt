Task Statement 5.1: Explain methods to secure AI systems.
Objectives:
• Identify AWS services and features to secure AI systems (for example, IAM
roles, policies, and permissions; encryption; Amazon Macie; AWS
PrivateLink; AWS shared responsibility model).
• Understand the concept of source citation and documenting data origins
(for example, data lineage, data cataloging, SageMaker Model Cards).
• Describe best practices for secure data engineering (for example, assessing
data quality, implementing privacy-enhancing technologies, data access
control, data integrity).
• Understand security and privacy considerations for AI systems (for example,
application security, threat detection, vulnerability management,
infrastructure protection, prompt injection, encryption at rest and in
transit). 

Task Statement 5.2: Recognize governance and compliance regulations for AI
systems.
Objectives:
• Identify regulatory compliance standards for AI systems (for example,
International Organization for Standardization [ISO], System and
Organization Controls [SOC], algorithm accountability laws).
• Identify AWS services and features to assist with governance and regulation
compliance (for example, AWS Config, Amazon Inspector, AWS Audit
Manager, AWS Artifact, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Trusted Advisor).
• Describe data governance strategies (for example, data lifecycles, logging,
residency, monitoring, observation, retention).
• Describe processes to follow governance protocols (for example, policies,
review cadence, review strategies, governance frameworks such as the
Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix, transparency standards, team
training requirements).
