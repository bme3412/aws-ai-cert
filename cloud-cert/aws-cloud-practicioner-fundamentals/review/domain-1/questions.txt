8. What are the benefits of developing and running a new application in the AWS Cloud compared to on-premises? (Select TWO.)

A
AWS automatically distributes the data globally for higher durability.

Incorrect. AWS does not automatically move data out of the AWS Region where you have placed it. Some services offer features to accomplish this. However, user data and its distribution is the responsibility of the user.

B
Trade operational excellence for agility.

Incorrect. Agility and designing for operational excellence are both advantages of the AWS Cloud. You would not trade an advantage of operational excellence for an agility advantage.



C
Trade fixed expenses for variable expenses.

Correct. An advantage of the AWS Cloud is to trade fixed expenses for variable expenses. With the AWS Cloud, you only pay for what you use. Therefore, you can move away from fixed expenses. With fixed expenses, you pay upfront, regardless of whether you use the full capacity. For example, to maintain your own data centers and servers would be a fixed expense.



D
Trade elasticity for performance.

Incorrect. Performance and elasticity are both advantages of the AWS Cloud. You would not trade an elasticity advantage for a performance advantage.


10. A company has on-premises compute resources that are fully utilized at the end of each month. However, during the remainder of the month, those resources are underutilized.

Which AWS Cloud benefit would BEST address this issue?

A
High availability

Incorrect. High availability focuses on ensuring that your resources are available when needed. It does not focus directly on resource utilization.


B
Elasticity

Correct. The AWS Cloud gives you the ability to stop planning capacity and let it automatically scale up when needed and scale down as demand goes down. This elasticity could stop you from having underutilized resources.


C
Security

Incorrect. Although security is always a prime consideration, it is unrelated to having underutilized resources. Managing resources is more related to elasticity.


D
Loose coupling

Incorrect. Loose coupling, or decoupling, refers to the design principle of separating resources in the design architecture. Decoupling your architecture prevents your entire system from failing if one component fails. Loose coupling is unrelated to having underutilized on-premises resources.

11. A company has an application that has dependencies between its underlying components. When one component fails, the entire application fails.

Which AWS Cloud design principle should be applied to address the current weakness of the application?

A
Implement elasticity, which enables the application to scale up or scale down as demand changes

Incorrect. Elasticity is the ability to acquire resources as you need them and release resources when you no longer need them. In the cloud, you want to perform this process automatically. However, the question describes an application that will benefit from decoupling. Be aware that the two can be related. When an application has been decoupled, each component benefits from elastic scaling.

B
Enable several Amazon EC2 instances to run in parallel to achieve better performance

Incorrect. Although running instances in parallel can increase performance, the question describes a monolithic application. The principle that makes this application more resilient and flexible is the decoupling of the application.

C
Decouple components by isolating them and ensuring that individual components can function when other components fail

Correct. You can decouple an application into component applications, or microservices, to isolate parts of the application. A failure in a component does not cause a failure of the entire application. This solution also presents opportunities to scale the subcomponents independently.

D
Double Amazon EC2 computing resources to increase system fault tolerance

Incorrect. Doubling computing resources will only affect fault tolerance if the application is already preserving the state of transactions that are being processed. The principle that makes this application more resilient and flexible is the decoupling of the application.

12. A company is starting its migration to the AWS Cloud. The company wants to use AWS experience and best practices to help ensure its success in moving to the AWS Cloud. The company wants a combination of business-oriented and technical points of view.

Which AWS service or guidance will meet these requirements?

A
AWS Well-Architected Framework

Incorrect. The Well-Architected Framework helps cloud architects to build secure, efficient, high-performing, and resilient infrastructures on AWS. The Well-Architected Framework is primarily focused on the technical point of view, rather than a combination of technical and business points of view.

B
AWS Control Tower

Incorrect. AWS Control Tower would help the company set up and govern an AWS multi-account environment that follows AWS best practices. However, AWS Control Tower does not provide guidance on moving to the AWS Cloud.


C
AWS Cloud Adoption Framework (AWS CAF)

Correct. AWS CAF identifies capabilities in six perspectives that support successful transitions to the AWS Cloud. The six perspectives include business, people, governance, platform, security, and operations.

D
AWS Trusted Advisor

Incorrect. Trusted Advisor inspects an AWS environment and makes recommendations about improvements and changes that can be made. The recommendations can help to increase security, reduce costs, and improve system performance and availability. However, Trusted Advisor does not provide guidance on how to move to the AWS Cloud.

15. A user wants the ability to easily scale compute resources in and out, while only paying for the resources used.

Which benefit of the AWS Cloud should the user take advantage of?

A
Elasticity

Correct. In the AWS Cloud, compute resources are elastic, which means that they can quickly scale to match the requirements of a specific application. Elasticity gives you the ability to match the supply of resources to demand, which gives you the ability to scale compute resources based on demand.



B
Fault tolerance

Incorrect. Fault tolerance is the property that gives a system the ability to continue operating properly in the event of the failure. Fault tolerance is not related to the ability to scale compute resources based on usage.


C
Durability

Incorrect. Durability is the ability of a system to remain functional when faced with the challenges of normal operation over its lifetime. Durability is not related to the ability to scale compute resources based on usage.


D
High availability

Incorrect. High availability refers to a system or component that is continuously operational. High availability is not related to the ability to scale compute resources based on usage.
