    <h1>AWS Security: Study Guide</h1>

    <h2>The Shared Responsibility Model</h2>
    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Customer and AWS Responsibilities</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AWS is responsible for the security <strong>of</strong> the cloud. This includes the physical security of data centers, hardware, software, networking, and facilities that run AWS services.</li>
            <li>The customer is responsible for security <strong>in</strong> the cloud. This includes managing data, configuring operating systems, network and firewall rules, and managing user access and permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> For EC2, AWS manages the hypervisor and physical infrastructure. The customer is responsible for the guest operating system, applications, and data.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Identity & Access Management (IAM)</h2>
    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Root User</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The root user is created when you first open your AWS account and has complete access to all services and resources.</li>
            <li>It is highly recommended to secure the root user with <strong>Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)</strong> and not use it for everyday tasks.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>IAM Users, Groups, and Roles</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>IAM Users:</strong> An identity with specific permissions. By default, new users have no permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>IAM Groups:</strong> A collection of IAM users. Permissions are applied to the group, and all users in the group inherit those permissions.</li>
            <li><strong>IAM Roles:</strong> An identity with temporary permissions that can be assumed by users, applications, or services. Roles are useful for granting temporary access without sharing long-term credentials.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>IAM Policies</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Policies are JSON documents that explicitly define permissions. They state what actions are allowed or denied on which AWS resources.</li>
            <li>The <strong>Principle of Least Privilege</strong> is a key concept: grant only the permissions necessary to perform a task.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Managing Multiple Accounts</h2>
    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>AWS Organizations</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows you to centrally manage and govern multiple AWS accounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Consolidated Billing:</strong> Combines billing for all accounts into a single payment, often providing access to bulk discounts.</li>
            <li><strong>Organizational Units (OUs):</strong> Group accounts with similar business or security requirements to simplify management.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Control Policies (SCPs):</strong> Centrally control permissions for accounts in your organization, setting maximum permissions for member accounts.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Security, Compliance, and Data Protection</h2>
    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Encryption</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Encryption at Rest:</strong> Encrypts data that is stored. AWS KMS can be used to manage encryption keys for services like S3, EBS, and DynamoDB.</li>
            <li><strong>Encryption in Transit:</strong> Encrypts data that is moving between locations, typically using SSL/TLS.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS Key Management Service (KMS):</strong> A managed service that makes it easy to create and control cryptographic keys.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Compliance</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>AWS maintains compliance with many global and regional standards. Customers inherit these controls.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS Artifact:</strong> Provides on-demand access to AWS's security and compliance reports from third-party auditors.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Compliance Center:</strong> A resource to find information and documentation about AWS compliance.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Threat Detection and Mitigation</h2>
    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>DDoS Protection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack aims to make an application unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS Shield:</strong> A managed DDoS protection service. Shield Standard is enabled automatically for all customers at no extra cost. Shield Advanced provides additional protections for a fee.</li>
            <li><strong>AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall):</strong> Helps protect web applications from common web exploits by filtering and monitoring HTTP/HTTPS requests.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Security Assessment & Threat Detection</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Amazon Inspector:</strong> An automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS. It checks for vulnerabilities and deviations from best practices.</li>
            <li><strong>Amazon GuardDuty:</strong> A threat detection service that continuously monitors for malicious activity and unauthorized behavior to protect your AWS accounts and workloads. It analyzes VPC Flow Logs, CloudTrail event logs, and DNS logs.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
