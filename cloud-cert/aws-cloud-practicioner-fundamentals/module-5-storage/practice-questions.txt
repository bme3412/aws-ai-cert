This document contains multiple-choice practice questions based on the storage and database modules. The Answer Key is located at the bottom of the file.

### Section 1: Core Storage Concepts (EBS, S3, EFS)

**1. What is the fundamental difference between an EC2 Instance Store and an EBS volume regarding data persistence?**
    a) EBS volumes are ephemeral, while Instance Stores are persistent.
    b) Data on an Instance Store persists after stopping the instance, while EBS data is deleted.
    c) Data on an EBS volume persists independently of the instance's lifecycle, while Instance Store data is deleted when the instance is stopped or terminated.
    d) Both EBS and Instance Stores are persistent, but only EBS supports snapshots.

**2. You are running a critical database on an EC2 instance and cannot tolerate data loss if the instance is stopped. Which storage option is required?**
    a) Amazon S3
    b) EC2 Instance Store
    c) Amazon EFS
    d) Amazon EBS

**3. How are EBS volumes backed up, and what is a key characteristic of these backups after the initial one?**
    a) By creating replicas, which are always full copies of the volume.
    b) By taking snapshots, where every snapshot is a full copy of the volume.
    c) By taking snapshots, where subsequent snapshots are incremental, only saving changed blocks.
    d) By copying data to an EFS file system, which is done automatically every hour.

**4. Your application needs to store and distribute large, highly durable media files (like videos and images) globally. Which AWS service is the best fit?**
    a) Amazon RDS
    b) Amazon EBS
    c) Amazon S3
    d) Amazon EFS

**5. In Amazon S3, what is the relationship between "buckets" and "objects"?**
    a) Buckets are containers for objects; objects are the actual data files.
    b) Objects are containers for buckets; buckets are the actual data files.
    c) Buckets and objects are both terms for the same thing: a data file.
    d) A bucket is a folder inside an object.

**6. Which S3 feature allows you to automate the process of moving data between different storage classes based on its age?**
    a) S3 Versioning
    b) S3 Lifecycle Policies
    c) S3 Cross-Region Replication
    d) S3 Access Analyzer

**7. A web application requires multiple EC2 instances to access and modify a shared set of files at the same time. Which service provides a shared file system for this purpose?**
    a) Amazon EFS
    b) Amazon EBS
    c) EC2 Instance Store
    d) Amazon S3

**8. What is a key architectural difference between an EBS volume and an EFS file system in terms of regional scope?**
    a) Both EBS and EFS are global services.
    b) EBS is a regional service (multi-AZ), while EFS is scoped to a single Availability Zone.
    c) EBS is scoped to a single Availability Zone, while EFS is a regional service that stores data across multiple Availability Zones.
    d) Both EBS and EFS are scoped to a single Availability Zone.

### Section 2: Database Services (RDS, Aurora, DynamoDB)

**9. Amazon RDS is described as a "managed service." What does this mean?**
    a) You are responsible for all database administration, including patching and backups.
    b) AWS automates tasks like hardware provisioning and database patching, allowing you to focus on your application.
    c) It is a serverless database that requires no management at all.
    d) It only supports a single database engine that you manage yourself.

**10. Amazon Aurora is a proprietary AWS database engine that is compatible with which two open-source relational databases?**
    a) Oracle and Microsoft SQL Server
    b) MongoDB and DynamoDB
    c) MySQL and PostgreSQL
    d) Redshift and Neptune

**11. What is a primary advantage of using Amazon Aurora over a standard relational database on RDS?**
    a) It is cheaper but has lower performance.
    b) It offers significantly higher performance and enhanced durability with six copies of your data across three AZs.
    c) It can only be used in a single Availability Zone.
    d) It does not require any backups.

**12. Which AWS database service is a serverless NoSQL database that provides single-digit millisecond latency for key-value workloads?**
    a) Amazon RDS for MySQL
    b) Amazon Redshift
    c) Amazon Aurora
    d) Amazon DynamoDB

**13. Which statement accurately describes the schema in Amazon DynamoDB?**
    a) It requires a rigid, predefined schema for all items in a table, similar to SQL databases.
    b) It has a flexible schema; only the primary key is required, and other attributes can vary between items.
    c) It does not support schemas at all.
    d) It requires a schema, but it can be changed at any time, causing significant downtime.

**14. Why is Amazon DynamoDB considered a "serverless" service?**
    a) Because you must provision and manage the underlying EC2 instances it runs on.
    b) Because it runs on your local server, not in the AWS cloud.
    c) Because you do not need to provision, patch, or manage servers; AWS handles all the underlying infrastructure.
    d) Because it is a relational database.

### Section 3: Specialized Data Services (Redshift, DMS, etc.)

**15. Which AWS service is a petabyte-scale data warehouse designed for running complex business intelligence (BI) and analytics queries?**
    a) Amazon DynamoDB
    b) Amazon Redshift
    c) Amazon RDS
    d) Amazon EFS

**16. What is the primary purpose of the AWS Database Migration Service (DMS)?**
    a) To automatically back up all AWS databases.
    b) To help migrate databases to or within AWS with minimal downtime.
    c) To convert database schemas from SQL to NoSQL.
    d) To analyze and optimize database query performance.

**17. During a database migration, when is the AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT) required?**
    a) For all migrations, regardless of the database engine.
    b) For homogeneous migrations (e.g., MySQL to MySQL).
    c) For heterogeneous migrations (e.g., Oracle to Aurora), where the source and target engines are different.
    d) The SCT is an optional tool that is never required.

**18. Which AWS service provides a managed graph database for applications that work with highly connected data, such as social networks?**
    a) Amazon QLDB
    b) Amazon Neptune
    c) Amazon DocumentDB
    d) Amazon RDS

**19. You need to add a caching layer to your relational database to improve read times for common requests. Which service should you use?**
    a) Amazon S3
    b) AWS DMS
    c) Amazon ElastiCache
    d) Amazon Redshift

**20. What is the name of the in-memory cache designed specifically to accelerate read performance for Amazon DynamoDB?**
    a) ElastiCache for Redis
    b) Amazon S3 Glacier
    c) AWS Schema Conversion Tool (SCT)
    d) DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX)
