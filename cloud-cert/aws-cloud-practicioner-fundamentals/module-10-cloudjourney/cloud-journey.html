    <h1>AWS Cloud Journey & Well-Architected Framework</h1>

    <h2>The AWS Well-Architected Framework</h2>
    <p>The Well-Architected Framework is designed to help cloud architects build secure, high-performance, resilient, and efficient infrastructure for their applications. It is composed of six pillars.</p>

    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Operational Excellence</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Security</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to protect information, systems, and assets while delivering business value through risk assessments and mitigation strategies.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Reliability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability of a system to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions, dynamically acquire computing resources to meet demand, and mitigate disruptions such as misconfigurations or transient network issues.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Performance Efficiency</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to use computing resources efficiently to meet system requirements and to maintain that efficiency as demand changes and technologies evolve.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Cost Optimization</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to run systems to deliver business value at the lowest price point.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Sustainability</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The ability to continually improve sustainability impacts by reducing energy consumption and increasing efficiency across all components of a workload by maximizing the benefits from the provisioned resources and minimizing the total resources required.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Benefits of the AWS Cloud</h2>

    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Trade Upfront Expense for Variable Expense</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Instead of investing heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you're going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Benefit from Massive Economies of Scale</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers like AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay-as-you-go prices.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Stop Guessing Capacity</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>With cloud computing, you don't have to predict how much infrastructure capacity you will need. You can access the capacity you need and scale in or out in response to demand.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Increase Speed and Agility</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The flexibility of cloud computing makes it easier to develop and deploy applications, giving your development teams more time to experiment and innovate.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Stop Spending Money on Data Centers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Focus on your applications and customers instead of on the undifferentiated heavy lifting of running and maintaining data centers.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="service-card">
        <h3>Go Global in Minutes</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The AWS Cloud global footprint enables you to quickly deploy applications to customers around the world, providing them with low latency.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>Module 10 Quiz</h2>
    <div class="service-card">
        <div class="quiz-question">
            <p><strong>1. Which pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework includes the ability to run workloads effectively and gain insights into their operations?</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cost Optimization</li>
                <li>Operational Excellence</li>
