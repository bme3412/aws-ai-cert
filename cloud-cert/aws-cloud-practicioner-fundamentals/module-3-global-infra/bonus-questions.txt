1. What are benefits of running a database on Amazon RDS compared to an on-premises database? (Select TWO.)

A
RDS provides backups by default.


B
RDS supports any relational database.


C
RDS costs the same regardless of the database engine that is used.


D
RDS database compute capacity can be easily scaled.


E
RDS security groups are managed by AWS.

A
RDS provides backups by default.

Correct. When using Amazon RDS, you can decide how frequently backups are completed. However, AWS manages the backing up of the data and the storing of the backup. Backups are automated based on the frequency that you define.



B
RDS supports any relational database.

Incorrect. Amazon RDS does not support all relational databases but, instead, supports a variety of popular relational database engines, which include Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and SQL Server.


C
RDS costs the same regardless of the database engine that is used.

Incorrect. Some third-party database engines have different costs than others because there is a third-party license fee that is incurred for using the database. Therefore, the cost can vary depending on the database engine.


D
RDS database compute capacity can be easily scaled.

Correct. Amazon RDS database instances can be scaled up or down based on demand. This can often be completed with little to no downtime. A database instance can also be scaled vertically to give it more memory or compute capacity.



E
RDS security groups are managed by AWS.

Incorrect. Although security groups are used to control traffic inbound and outbound for a database instance, they are managed by the user and are not managed by AWS.


2. What should AWS edge locations be used for? (Select TWO.)

A
Hosting applications and databases


B
Delivering content closer to users


C
Running NoSQL database caching services


D
Reducing the load on Amazon EC2 based web servers


E
Sending notification messages to end users

A. Hosting applications and databases

Incorrect. AWS edge locations are used as points of presence around the world for users to connect to the AWS network. Although you can run functions at edge locations using Lambda@Edge, you cannot host applications or databases at the edge locations.


B
Delivering content closer to users

Correct. AWS edge locations are used to host the content delivery network (CDN) service Amazon CloudFront, which gives you the ability to cache frequently accessed data closer to end users. This ability can reduce latency in data retrieval times for end users all over the world because the edge locations are often closer to the end users than the region in which the data is hosted.


C
Running NoSQL database caching services

Incorrect. Although you can cache data at edge locations using services such as Amazon S3 as the origin, a different pattern is generally followed for caching information that comes from a NoSQL database. The cache for a NoSQL database would be located inside an AWS Region, not the edge location.


D
Reducing the load on Amazon EC2 based web servers

Correct. AWS edge locations are used to host the content delivery network (CDN) service Amazon CloudFront, which gives you the ability to cache frequently accessed data closer to end users. When data is cached at an edge location and an end user requests data, the request is first routed to the edge location. If the data is found at the edge location, then the data is returned to the end user and the request never reaches the back-end server. This reduces the load on back-end servers because some requests are being offloaded to the edge location.


E
Sending notification messages to end users

Incorrect. Edge locations are not used to send notification messages to end users or run applications that send messages to end users, and because of this reason, this answer is incorrect. Notification messages would likely come from a service or program hosted in an AWS Region.

3. Which AWS services or features support data replication across AWS Regions? (Select TWO.)

A
Amazon S3

An instance store is ideal for temporary storage of information that changes frequently. The data that is stored on an instance store is temporary. There is no built-in mechanism to replicate data across Regions.

D
AWS Storage Gateway

Incorrect. Storage Gateway connects an on-premises software appliance with cloud-based storage. Storage Gateway provides integration with data security features between your on-premises IT environment and AWS storage infrastructure such as Amazon S3.
