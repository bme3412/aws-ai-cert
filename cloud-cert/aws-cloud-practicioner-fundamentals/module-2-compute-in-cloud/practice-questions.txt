    a) Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)
    b) Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)
    c) Elastic Load Balancing
    d) AWS Lambda

**7. An application needs to send a single notification that will be delivered to multiple different subscriber endpoints, such as an SQS queue, a Lambda function, and an email address. Which service supports this "fan-out" messaging model?**
    a) Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)
    b) AWS Fargate
    c) Elastic Load Balancing
    d) Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service)

    b) The application code runs directly on the client's machine.
    c) No servers are used at any point in the application's lifecycle.
    d) The service requires you to use a dedicated physical server.
