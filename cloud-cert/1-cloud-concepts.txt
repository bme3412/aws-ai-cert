Domain 1: Fundamentals of AI and ML
Task Statement 1.1: Explain basic AI concepts and terminologies.
Objectives:
• Define basic AI terms (for example, AI, ML, deep learning, neural networks,
computer vision, natural language processing [NLP], model, algorithm,
training and inferencing, bias, fairness, fit, large language model [LLM]).
• Describe the similarities and differences between AI, ML, and deep learning.
• Describe various types of inferencing (for example, batch, real-time).
• Describe the different types of data in AI models (for example, labeled and
unlabeled, tabular, time-series, image, text, structured and unstructured).
• Describe supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement
learning. 

Task Statement 1.2: Identify practical use cases for AI.
Objectives:
• Recognize applications where AI/ML can provide value (for example, assist
human decision making, solution scalability, automation).
• Determine when AI/ML solutions are not appropriate (for example, costbenefit analyses, situations when a specific outcome is needed instead of a
prediction).
• Select the appropriate ML techniques for specific use cases (for example,
regression, classification, clustering).
• Identify examples of real-world AI applications (for example, computer
vision, NLP, speech recognition, recommendation systems, fraud detection,
forecasting).
• Explain the capabilities of AWS managed AI/ML services (for example,
SageMaker, Amazon Transcribe, Amazon Translate, Amazon Comprehend,
Amazon Lex, Amazon Polly). 

Task Statement 1.3: Describe the ML development lifecycle.
Objectives:
• Describe components of an ML pipeline (for example, data collection,
exploratory data analysis [EDA], data pre-processing, feature engineering,
model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, deployment,
monitoring).
• Understand sources of ML models (for example, open source pre-trained
models, training custom models).
• Describe methods to use a model in production (for example, managed API
service, self-hosted API).
• Identify relevant AWS services and features for each stage of an ML pipeline
(for example, SageMaker, Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, Amazon
SageMaker Feature Store, Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor). 
Understand fundamental concepts of ML operations (MLOps) (for example,
experimentation, repeatable processes, scalable systems, managing
technical debt, achieving production readiness, model monitoring, model
re-training).
• Understand model performance metrics (for example, accuracy, Area Under
the ROC Curve [AUC], F1 score) and business metrics (for example, cost per
user, development costs, customer feedback, return on investment [ROI]) to
evaluate ML models.
